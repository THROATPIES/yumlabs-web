## Urban Farming or Microgreens Business: 
- If you enjoy gardening, you could explore urban farming. Microgreens or small-scale organic farming can be done in a small space and sold to local restaurants, markets, or through subscription services. Washington is known for sustainable living, and this would fit the demand.

## Custom Outdoor Gear Production: 
- With your skills in working with tools and computers, you could design and create custom outdoor gear or equipment, like camping accessories, hammocks, or lightweight outdoor furniture. Starting with a small, niche market would allow you to grow your business over time.

## Portable Solar Installation Kits: 
- Leverage your computer skills to design or sell portable solar panel kits for outdoor enthusiasts. These kits could power camping gear, tools, or small homes, and be marketed to environmentally conscious consumers in Washington.
